## CS661 Project
### Visual Analytics on Air Pollutants in India
### Overview
This project offers a comprehensive visual analysis of air pollution and its health impacts across India, covering the period from 2021 to 2023. Developed as part of the CS661: Big Data Visual Analytics course, this initiative employs advanced data visualization techniques to explore temporal trends, spatial distributions, and the health ramifications of air pollutants like Ozone (O3), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), PM10, and PM2.5.

### Project Goals
The project aims to:

* Visualize how air quality changes over time and across different regions.
* Analyze the health impacts of air pollution, focusing on respiratory health.
* Develop an interactive web-based visualization platform for users to explore and analyze AQI data and its implications with ease.
### Features
* Temporal Analysis: Trends over time to identify periods of high pollution.
* Spatial Visualization: Maps showing pollution distribution across states.
* Health Impact Analysis: Correlations between pollution levels and respiratory health outcomes.
Interactive Dashboard: A web-based platform for dynamic data exploration.
### Data
The dataset includes daily AQI measurements from 2021 to 2023 across Indian states, sourced from Kaggle. It provides detailed information on various pollutants and metadata including date, state, city, and monitoring stations.

### Technologies
* JavaScript & D3.js: For creating interactive visualizations.
* Python: Used for data preprocessing and analysis.
* Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
### Visualization Techniques
* Choropleth Maps: For visualizing spatial data.
* Bar Charts: For demographic data.
* Time Series Plots: For temporal trends.
* Parallel Coordinate Plots: For multi-dimensional analysis.
* PCA and t-SNE: For dimensionality reduction and visualization of high-dimensional data.
